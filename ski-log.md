1. January 1 - Niseko, Japan - 20cm more. Made it over to Niseko and Hirafu resorts. Some great terrain over there.

1. February 26 - Squaw - Lots of park. 180s off big jumps feel solid. 360s need more work, but landed a few off the larger jump! ([Strava](https://app.strava.com/activities/260230869))

1. April 5 - Haines, AK - Late start but more great snow and light. Had a big crash on my last run but no injuries. Still lots to learn about navigating this sort of terrain. <a href="http://instagram.com/p/1HqrhqkA-L/" class="socicon instagram"></a>
1. April 13 - Haines, AK - Extended my trip by two days in order to catch this day of clear weather. Worth it!
