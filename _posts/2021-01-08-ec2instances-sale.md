title: Vantage acquires ec2instances.info
---

For [almost a decade]({% post_url 2011-03-10-hosting-a-static-site-on-amazon-s3-ec2instances-info %}) I've run a site that helps people compare [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instances called [ec2instances.info](https://ec2instances.info). Yep, that's a [.info domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.info)! It's essentially a giant spreadsheet of data aggregated from numerous Amazon webpages and APIs.

In recent years I haven't been able to give the site much attention, so was very excited when [Vantage](https://vantage.sh) reached out about acquiring it. They plan to make improvements in addition to building their impressive cost monitoring dashboard. Check them out at [Vantage.sh](https://vantage.sh), their [launch post on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25750807), or YouTube:
