While giving an interview recently I realized that some of the important dates in HipCal history were getting a little fuzzy. Here's an official time line;

**Fall semester, 2004** - I make the first version of MyPIMP in my [EIW](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~hollingd/eiw-2004/) class at [RPI](http://www.rpi.edu/). ~30 fraternity brothers and friends were using it.

**Winter break, 2004** -  Pete & I were talking on AIM and decided that we wanted to make a website. We chose MyPIMP since it had already been started.

**Spring semester, 2005** - Pete, Chris, Tawheed, Glenn, and I start planning features, prototyping, and working on the PHP framework.

**Summer, 2005** - Pete, Glenn, and I stay at [AXP](http://rpicrows.com/) in Troy and work on the site daily. Chris and Tawheed work from the east coast while not at their real jobs.

**September 4th, 2005** - [Launch!](http://www.hipcal.com/blogs/?p=88) MyPIMP goes live and we start spreading the word around campus. Most new users are our friends and classmates.

**Fall semester, 2005** -  We continue adding features including an interface upgrade, [Groups](http://www.hipcal.com/blogs/?p=97), iCal support, and [DST support](http://www.hipcal.com/blogs/?p=96).

**November 17th, 2005** - We [change the name](http://www.hipcal.com/blogs/?p=98) of the site to HipCal, enabling more users to feel comfortable using the site. We did not take church calendar users into consideration before this point!

**Winter break, 2005** - HipCal is having some serious server issues. We weren't really sure what to do since none of us had run a website before...

**January 19th, 2006** - We get an email from [Rikk Carey](http://rikkcarey.wordpress.com/) over at Plaxo asking if we'd like to chat. We give him a call and are soon booked on a flight out there to meet the team.

**February 5-7th, 2006** - We fly out to Mountain View to meet everyone at Plaxo. Product visions are shared and both sides seem very excited about moving forward.

**Late February, 2006** - Legal documents are passed back and forth while we try to figure out what each of us would be doing at Plaxo.

**April 10th, 2006** - [Mark Jen](http://blog.plaxoed.com/) visits us in Troy while on the east coast for a blogging conference. We get our office set up as a Plaxo satellite office so we can start working.

**Late April, 2006** - Pete and I are doing tons of press interviews (under embargo) while getting slammed with homework. It's fun.

**May 1st, 2006** - [News of the acquisition](http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2006/04/question_what_d_1.html) finally goes public! [Here](http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2006/05/were_listening_2.html)'s some more press.

**May 16th, 2006** - A small Plaxo + HipCal [party](http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2006/05/hipcal_plaxo_pa_1.html) is thrown at the Plaxo offices while we're out there on a 4 day visit.

**May 20th, 2006** - Glenn, Pete, and Tawheed graduate from RPI.

**June 5th, 2006** - We [begin our road trip](http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2006/06/on_the_road_to.html) across the country.

**June 10th, 2006** - We arrive at [our new place](http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2006/06/day_7_homeward_1.html) in Los Altos.

**June 12th, 2006** - First day of work at Plaxo!

--- Year of work ---

**June 24th, 2007** - The new Plaxo 3.0 is [released](http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2007/06/introducing_an.html).

The next few items added to this list will be very exciting. I wish I could add them now, but you'll just have to wait!
