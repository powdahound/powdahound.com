Snagged [phound.com](http://phound.com) the other day. (p for powda, not a lame spelling of found.com) It just redirects to powdahound.com, nothing special. THought it would have been taken but apparently not.

On another note, classes ended this wednesday and I go home next friday the 7th! So far grades are looking good. :)
