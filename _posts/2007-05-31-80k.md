I just hit 80,000 miles in my [2000 Volvo V40](http://www.edmunds.com/volvo/v40/2000/index.html) while driving to work! It's [not much](http://j-walkblog.com/index.php?/weblog/posts/248_million_miles_on_a_volvo/) for a Volvo so I'm sure it'll last for another few years - especially with the mild CA weather.
