Last week the desktop computer I had been using since my junior year in high school began breaking down in ways strange enough to warrant its retirement. I'm sure I could have fixed it by replacing a few parts but it's obviously much more exciting to build a brand new rig! Thanks to [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com) I'm now running:

  * eVGA GeForce 7950GT 512MB KO  ([link](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130066))
  * AMD Athlon 64 X2 5000+ ([link](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103030))
  * ASUS M2N-SLI ([link](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131013))
  * 2BG of Corsair XMS2 DDR2 ([link](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145034))
  * 2x250g WD SATA2 drives in RAID 1 (losing drives is painful!)
  * Other power-hungry parts
  * 700w OCZ power supply (no I don't need 700w, but it was only $10 more than the 520w!)

It's nice being able to revisit the games that ran poorly on my old machine such as Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Hitman: Blood Money, etc. I haven't found a game that this rig can't handle, but I'm sure I [won't be saying that for too much longer](http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/crysis/index.html). Better enjoy it while I can. :)
