[![Plaxo 3.0 Pulse](http://www.powdahound.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/3_pulse_3qtr.thumbnail.jpg)](http://www.powdahound.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/3_pulse_3qtr.jpg)Last night we released [Plaxo 3.0](http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2007/06/introducing_an.html), the product [us HipCal guys](http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2006/04/question_what_d_1.html) have been working on at Plaxo for the past year. It feels great to have finally shipped a product and is nice to [see](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070625/tc_nm/internet_plaxo_dc;_ylt=AnqaohbVWMj.YZidAY6xkWdT.3QA) [all](http://gigaom.com/2007/06/24/plaxo-3-0/) [the](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/24/new-version-of-plaxo-launched-more-sync-more-often/) [positive ](http://mashable.com/2007/06/24/plaxo-2/)[press](http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2007/06/linkedin-and-pl.html) [coverage](http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/06/plaxo-one-pim-a.html). There's nothing more motivating than positive feedback!

Plaxo 3.0's front end is written primarily in JavaScript, a technology which very few others are using to create applications of this size. All of us have learned more than we ever thought we'd know about this little scripting language! Although JavaScript is fun to use, I'm really enjoying the switch back to PHP which we're using for some of our future products.

My main contributions to Plaxo 3.0 were the calendar views, [new WAP](http://m.plaxo.com/), and Pulse. Features like countdowns and a more interactive upcoming view were ideas we had for [HipCal](http://www.hipcal.com/), and it's great to see them make an appearance in 3.0. It's also nice to see the new WAP, which I originally started as a small side project, make it to a shippable state within a few weeks, bringing us all one step closer to the "poor man PDA" (now we just need SMS alerts!). Pulse is just plain cool, and I'm very excited to watch it grow over the next few months.

Anyway, back to work!
