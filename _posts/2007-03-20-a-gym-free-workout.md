[Pete](http://petercurley.com/) showed us [a workout](http://www.simplefit.org/workouts.html) today that he said was inspired by the workout the guys did for the movie [300](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/). Although I didn't see that mentioned anywhere, the workout still looks good. I've never liked going to the gym (and haven't even used my Plaxo employee pass at Gold's), but I do love that post-workout feeling of relaxation and sore muscles. I've been biking 30 miles almost every weekend but I find myself getting a little restlessÂ  due to lack of physical activity when Wednesday rolls around. Hopefully this will help keep me relaxed as well as get me in shape.

The simplefit workout has a few benefits as I see it:



	
  * It's simple - just 3 different exercises 3 times a week; and I don't have to go anywhere to do it!

	
  * It's not always the same - although each of the 3 workouts use the same exercises they're presented in such a way that each day will (hopefully) feel like a different challenge

	
  * It's rewarding - the way its set up into different levels gives you something to focus on besides just getting more fit and helps you realize the progress you've made so far


I'm sure other workouts have similar structure and simplicity but I didn't really care to do any research. :) So today I did a 'Day 1' workout and completed 56 sets in the 20 minutes. The pull-ups are definitely my bottleneck at this point.
Hopefully in a few weeks it'll get a little warmer out and I can bike to work every day (it's just under 7 miles). It will be really nice to bike home after a long day instead of sitting in traffic. Exercise is such great stress relief, and it'd be stupid of me not to take advantage of the great CA weather.
