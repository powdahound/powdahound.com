In order to learn a bit more about [screen scraping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_scraping) with [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/), I coded up a script to generate an RSS feed of [Safeway](http://safeway.com)'s weekly specials. The number of frames and strange redirects on [Safeway.com](http://www.safeway.com) shows that they probably paid some lifeless company a ton of money to develop it for them ([Vertis](http://www.vertisinc.com/), in this case). I can only imagine the frustration their engineers must have while trying to debug this stuff.

Try it out, and let me know how it works for you:Â [Safeway Weekly Specials RSS](http://www.powdahound.com/safeway-specials/).

Btw the code is on GitHub: [http://github.com/powdahound/safewayspecials](http://github.com/powdahound/safewayspecials)
