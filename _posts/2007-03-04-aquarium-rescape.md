Took a few hours yesterday to do a major rescape (re-landscape) of my tank to make more room for plants and give them better lighting.

It should be much easier to clean the back of the tank now (I think it was getting so full of fish poop that the water always looked dirty). I'm planning on picking up a few new plants in the next few days so hopefully in a few weeks they'll fill in and I'll be able to take an awesome 'after' shot to post.
