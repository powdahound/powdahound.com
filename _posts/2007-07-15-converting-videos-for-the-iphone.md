I've been very happy with my iPhone (writeup to come later) but had some trouble figuring out how to convert movies to its native format in an easy way. Here's what I've found out;



	
  * The iPhone's resolution is 320x480 at 160ppi.

	
  * The video formats are MP4 and H.264 ([MPEG-4 Part 10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC)).

	
  * On the Mac and PC, [HandBrake](http://handbrake.m0k.org/) can rip DVDs to mp4 format.

	
  * On the PC, [XviD4PSP](http://www.winnydows.com/xvid4psp.html) can convert DivX and XviD files to mp4 format (I just used the "iPod Video 640" option) as well as join files together.


I don't know much about video formats, aspect ratios, or encoding, but all the videos I've converted so far play on the iPhone and look great!
