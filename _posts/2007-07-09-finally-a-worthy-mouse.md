After using the old [Microsoft Intellimouse](http://www.powdahound.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/intellimouse.jpg) mice for years no other mouse ever seemed as good. I tried a number of Logitech and other Microsoft mice but they always had small side buttons, a crappy scrollwheel, or were pathetically small. Unfortunately, the [newer versions](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Intellimouse-Explorer-with-Tilt-Wheel/dp/B00013VHAS) of the Intellimouse have poor reviews and strange ergonomics.

Last weekend I picked up the new(ish) Microsoft [Habu mouse](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/gaming/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=092) at Fry's and was back again today buying a second one for my desktop at home. The design is very similar to the Intellimouse v2 and it looks great. It costs $60, but even if it lasts for half the 7 years that my old Intellimouse did I'll consider it money well spent.
