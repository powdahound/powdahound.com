Glad to see that there's an end in sight for PHP 4. From the [php.net](http://php.net) news:

> Today it is exactly three years ago since PHP 5 has been released. In those three years it has seen many improvements over PHP 4. PHP 5 is fast, stable & production-ready and as PHP 6 is on the way, PHP 4 will be discontinued.The PHP development team hereby announces that support for PHP 4 will continue until the end of this year only. After 2007-12-31 there will be no more releases of PHP 4.4. We will continue to make critical security fixes available on a case-by-case basis until 2008-08-08. Please use the rest of this year to make your application suitable to run on PHP 5.For documentation on migration for PHP 4 to PHP 5, we would like to point you to our migration guide. There is additional information available in the PHP 5.0 to PHP 5.1 and PHP 5.1 to PHP 5.2 migration guides as well.

Hopefully this forces some people to upgrade their apps and allow the devs to focus on PHP5 more. Aside from the better OOP in PHP5 which I find to improve my development a lot, I have to [agree with Matt](http://photomatt.net/2007/07/13/on-php/) in that we should all be spending our time on "design, copywriting, information, performance â€” the things that truly matter." Does that make me a hypocrite for posting this?
