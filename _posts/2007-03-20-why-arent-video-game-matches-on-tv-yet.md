Was just reading over on [WoW Insider](http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/03/19/5v5-arena-team-is-first-to-go-professional/) that a few 5-man arena teams [are now sponsored](http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/03/19/5v5-arena-team-is-first-to-go-professional/) and it made me wonder why we aren't seeing competitive video games on TV yet. It's obviously coming, but when? Are there not enough people interested in watching? Does that mean that there _are_ enough people interested in watching half the other crap that's on TV currently? There are a number of professional gamers and gaming teams that make a living off tournament winnings so clearly there's some serious money being put into it. There must be dozens of games out there with communities large enough to have an active, competitive community.
I give it 2 years before there's a channel dedicated to it or ESPN has some sort of coverage. Lucky headshots clearly deserve a place in the SportsCenter Top 10.

Also, I just noticed that the [OGL](http://www.worldogl.com/) is still around and is sporting the exact same website design they were when I was a member back in 1999.
