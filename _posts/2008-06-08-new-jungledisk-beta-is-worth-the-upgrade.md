The new [JungleDisk beta](http://www.jungledisk.com/betadownload.shtml) is a big improvement over their current version. The backup features have been greatly improved and now that I've [fixed](http://twitter.com/powdahound/statuses/829417546) my issue with Explorer locking up I can use it like almost like normal drive.

I'm still backing up my music and photos to a local [NAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) box, but I'm very impressed with the direction JungleDisk is going and will probably start to use it more (especially once the command line version is more mature and well documented).

Also, for $1/mo you can get [JungleDisk Plus](http://www.jungledisk.com/plus.shtml) which gives you web access, resumable uploads, and partial file uploads. Very cool!
