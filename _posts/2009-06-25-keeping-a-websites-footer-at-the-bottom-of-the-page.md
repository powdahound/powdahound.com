I was trying to do this and found these two links very helpful:

 * [Get down! How to keep footers at the bottom of the page](http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/keeping-footers-at-the-bottom-of-the-page)
 * [footerStickAlt: A more robust method of positioning a footer](http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2005/08/29/)
