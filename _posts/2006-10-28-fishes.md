I started my first aquarium in early August but hadn't taken any pictures of it until now (I need to get a camera of my own!). There are currently 19 fish and 5 different types of plants in here.

My goal is to take pictures regularly so that I can track the tank's progress. I'll put them in [this Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/powdahound/sets/72157594513404036).
