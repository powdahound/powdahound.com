While 'driving' by the [Plaxo](http://www.plaxo.com/) office using the new [Street View](http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/index.html) in [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) I noticed that [my car is visible](http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=0&layer=c&cbll=37.424835,-122.071445&cbp=1,20.9102935653636,0.499440689475263,2&ll=37.426914,-122.071388&spn=0.004925,0.008594&z=17) in the parking lot (it's the red wagon behind the lamp post in the center). Pretty cool! I don't have any privacy concerns about this feature like [some other people](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/01/1219256) do. Assuming the images are kept up to date it'll be very helpful when getting directions in confusing areas. It's also fun to look at all the funny images [people have found](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/05/request_for_urb.html).
