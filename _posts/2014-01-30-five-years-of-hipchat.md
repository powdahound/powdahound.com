Last week marked the 4th anniversary of [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com)'s [launch](http://blog.hipchat.com/2010/01/25/later-beta-hipchat-is-open-to-the-public/). We started prototyping it about a year before that which means that I've been focused on HipChat for about five years. That's longer than college or any previous jobs I've had, though it certainly doesn't feel like it. We've grown tremendously as a [product](http://blog.hipchat.com/category/releases/) and [team](https://www.hipchat.com/about) since [joining Atlassian](http://blog.hipchat.com/2012/03/07/weve-been-acquired-by-atlassian/) almost two years ago and 2014 is shaping up to be our most exciting yet!
