Today I received an email from Go Daddy with the title "Get www.Heaton.com for 25% off". Sweet! The domain is finally available!

![GoDaddy Heaton.com](http://powdahound.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/godaddy_heaton.png)

_"**This offer does not imply nor assure the availability of this specific .COM domain. Please use the links to search for this or other .COM variations."_

As if they couldn't have checked to see if the domain was available. I bet almost no one can get their last name as a .com domain these days. Makes me wonder how many other Heatons got this same email.
