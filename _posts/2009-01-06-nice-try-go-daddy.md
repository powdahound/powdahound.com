Today I received an email from Go Daddy with the title "Get www.Heaton.com for 25% off". Sweet! The domain is finally available!

![GoDaddy Heaton.com](/assets/godaddy_heaton.png)

> **This offer does not imply nor assure the availability of this specific .COM domain. Please use the links to search for this or other .COM variations.

As if they couldn't have checked to see if the domain was available. I bet almost no one can get their last name as a .com domain these days. Makes me wonder how many other Heatons got this same email.
