![Plaxo Mobile 3.0](http://labs.plaxo.com/labs/projects/mobile/screenshots/screenshot.png)For the past few weeks I've spent my spare time working working on a [new version](http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2007/04/alright_folks_t_1.html) of Plaxo's mobile access (WAP). It uses PHP, Smarty, and the new [Plaxo 3.0](http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2007/03/calling_all_beta_testers.html) APIs so I've had to do very little work myself. The hardest part by far has been getting the layout to look good on all sorts of phones.

Some of the cool features:



	
  * Data is always in sync with Outlook, Mac, Gmail, etc using thanks to 3.0's sync setup.

	
  * Main page shows my weather and calendar events for today and tomorrow -- usually that's all I want to see!

	
  * Add and edit tasks and notes. The only reason for me to use a paper todo list or grocery list was that I could take it with me. Now I can just keep my tasks/notes in Outlook and access them from anywhere.
(Outlook tasks and notes aren't implemented in the most user-friendly way, so I often just use the mobile access through my browser. We're hoping to get these features added to [3.0](http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2007/03/calling_all_beta_testers.html) soon!)


If you want to check it out just hit up [http://labs.plaxo.com/mobile/](http://labs.plaxo.com/mobile/) from your phone (should also work from your browser if you don't have a data plan or want to play with it first.
