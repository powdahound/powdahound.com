I just upgraded my [16-month-old](http://powdahound.com/2006/11/18/time-for-an-upgrade/) AMD 5000+ to an AMD 6400+ and my NVIDIA 7950GT-KO to an NVIDIA 8800GT and my 3DMark06 score of 5,704 rose to 11,338 (almost double). More importantly, games will be running more smoothly! :) I've been waiting to do this upgrade before playing through HL2:EP2, BioShock, Crysis, and CoD4. Hopefully I can find some time for gaming this summer!

One reason I chose the [MSI NX8800GT](http://www.nvnews.net/reviews/msi_geforce_nx8800gt/page_2.shtml) video card is that it comes overclocked and runs cooler than most of the regular 8800GTs. It accomplishes this by taking up 2 PCI slots with its giant heatsink. Unfortunately it's also so long that I had to remove a hard drive from the opposite side of the case just to make it fit! I need to consolidate my drives anyway, so this will give me some motivation.

Now I just need to get my Steam account working so I can play some games. For some reason I got locked out of it yesterday and their password reset process isn't working so well.

If you're interested in buying my used AMD 5000+ or NVIDIA 7950GT-KO just send me an email.
