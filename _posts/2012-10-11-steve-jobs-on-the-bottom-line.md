<blockquote>Jobs: We’ve been having record quarter after record quarter, so we’re very pleased with how the company’s doing. And, uh, you know, Wall Street, I’ve never been able to figure out Wall Street. **But someone once told me manage the top line, which is, your strategy, your talented people, and your execution, and the bottom line will take care of itself. And I’ve always found that to be the case.** So, we’re turning in record quarter after record quarter, and Wall Street eventually comes out in the right place.</blockquote>
