The first real product I ever worked on, [HipCal.com][hc] was "launched" a decade ago today. I use quotes there because it was a pretty uneventful launch. We uploaded a few hand-selected PHP files to our shared webhost via SmartFTP and then posted a barebones [blog post](http://web.archive.org/web/20070221003735/http://www.hipcal.com/blogs/?p=88). I have no memory of what we did after that, but it certainly didn't involve pitching tech blogs, posting on social media, or sending out an email blast. I don't think we even had a way to see how many users had signed up besides manually running a SQL query from the ugly cPanel admin interface our host provided.

It's fun to look back on this as a way to measure how much we've all learned since that point. Members of the team have since gone on to found [HipChat](https://hipchat.com), [ToutApp](https://toutapp.com), and [Balanced](https://www.balancedpayments.com), among other projects.

Here's to the next unpredictable 10 years!
