Hit 90k miles on the way to the gym last night in my 2000 Volvo V40. 16 months ago I hit [80k](http://powdahound.com/2007/05/80k) - slow progress!
[![90k on Flickr](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/2780811091_df48d0acf6.jpg?v=0)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/powdahound/2780811091/) [My stats](http://powdahound.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/mymilemarker_aug08.png) from [My Mile Marker](http://mymilemarker.com) show where I took longer trips (usually earning above average mpg).
