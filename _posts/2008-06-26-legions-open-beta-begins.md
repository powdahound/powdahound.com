[Fallen Empire: Legions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_Empire:_Legions) is now in [open beta](http://www.gamespot.com/pages/news/show_blog_entry.php?topic_id=26285381&om_act=convert&om_clk=gsupdates&tag=updates;title;1)! Just sign up at [InstantAction](http://www.instantaction.com/) to play. The game runs right in your browser but can be made fullscreen if you want.

Legions is a "spiritual successor" to the [Tribes series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribes_(video_game)) which have always been my favorite games. I haven't had much time to play yet but I'm hoping the game is good enough to capture the interest of the Tribes community if only for a little while.

Here's the most recent trailer (More videos on [Legions Players](http://www.legionsplayers.com/videos/)):
