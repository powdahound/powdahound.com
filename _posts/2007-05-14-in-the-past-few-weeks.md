...a lot has happened!

  * Went to [Jump Sky High](http://jumpskyhigh.com/) with a bunch of people from [Plaxo](http://www.plaxo.com/). It's basically 3 huge trampoline rooms and a foam pit that you get to play around on for $9/hr. We found it odd that you can only do flips on the trampolines and off the walls, but not into the foam pit. It only took a little practice before I could do decent back flips as well as flips off the trampoline walls. Maybe this summer I'll learn to do them [off any wall](http://www.wikihow.com/Run-up-a-Wall-and-Flip)...
  * Finished school this past Thursday and it feels great! In a few days I'm flying home for graduation which is on Sunday. Still waiting for the final grades to roll in.
  * Started using [Amazon S3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3) along with [JungleDisk](http://www.jungledisk.com/) and am enjoying it so far. Had Explorer lock up a few times when accessing the mounted drive in Windows but other than that it has been stable. Even though I have 2 300gb drives in mirrored raid in my desktop it feels good to have a remote backup of certain things. Losing data really sucks.
  * Got a new [50-200mm lens](http://www.amazon.com/Pentax-50-200mm-4-5-6-Samsung-Cameras/dp/B0009OAFI4) for my camera and have been able to take some cool macro shots. Since 50mm still feels zoomed in I'm sure I'll be switching to the 18-55mm lens that came with [the camera](http://www.amazon.com/Pentax-Digital-Reduction-18-55mm-3-5-5-6/dp/B000FTLSR0) for larger shots.
  * Finally signed up for [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) and am enjoying [Twitterific](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific) on my mac. Hopefully I can remember to update it reasonably often (I'm terrible with AIM away messages).
  * Been working on the new WAP for Plaxo (now at [m.plaxo.com](http://m.plaxo.com)!) and using it almost daily. If [my phone](http://reviews.cnet.com/LG_VX8300/4505-6454_7-31812933.html) had a button to jump to a specific WAP site I'm sure I'd use it even more.
  * Pre-ordered [Enemy Territory: Quake Wars](http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/enemyterritoryquakewars/) and am remaining optimistic about its release date and ability to deliver good gameplay. I hope I'm not let down!
