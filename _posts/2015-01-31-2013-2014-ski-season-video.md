I got my first GoPro, the HERO2, in 2011 and have been using it to record all my ski trips since. Not because I do anything that's really impressive, but because it's fun and a great way to review my skiing to look for ways to improve. If you haven't had the experience of recording something you thought was impressive on video yet, what usually happens is that the footage looks *incredibly* boring compared to how it felt at the time you recorded it. A 10 foot cliff looks like a 3 footer on the wide angle lens. Keep that in mind next time you see a POV video that really impresses you: it was far crazier for the person who recorded it.

Usually I make a season recap video in the fall as a way to get excited about the upcoming year, but this year's took me longer to finish. Mostly due to laziness, but I also wasn't too excited about the conditions on any of my trips last year. Hopefully this west coast draught will end soon, though 2014-2015 doesn't look like the season to make that happen so far.

Anyway, here's the video:

[Baldface lodge](http://www.baldface.net/) and [Whitewater](http://www.skiwhitewater.com/) in Nelson, BC were the season highlights even though a high-elevation rain event happened the week before I arrived. Hoping for more wintry conditions there this year.
