[Startup Control Panel](http://www.mlin.net/StartupCPL.shtml) (StartupCPL) is an awesome tool that lets you control exactly what programs load when you boot up your computer. Unless you just formatted, you probably have a bunch of crap loading that slows down your computer. Almost all of it can be turned off without breaking anything. [Try it out](http://www.mlin.net/StartupCPL.shtml) and see how much time you can save.
