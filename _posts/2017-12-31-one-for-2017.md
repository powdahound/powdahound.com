title: One for 2017
---

Haven't posted here since the start of 2016, so here's one before 2017 is officially over. Using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a platform to power this site seemed cool at the time, but it's a pain to update.

Here are my yearly ski movies for the past two seasons. Can't top the 2014-2015 season with Japan and Alaska though. Did try AK one more time in 2016 but had terrible warm conditions.
