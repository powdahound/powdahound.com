Maybe once school is done I'll find time to post something here that's worth reading/looking at. I realize that by blogging about blogging I'm being as lame as those podcasters who only talk about podcasting (old [Adam Curry](http://www.dailysourcecode.com/) podcasts come to mind). Therefore I'll direct you to [photos from my recent trip to Italy](http://flickr.com/photos/powdahound/sets/72157594544816554/)!

Be back in another 3 months...
