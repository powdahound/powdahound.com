Earlier this month I took a two week trip to Haines, AK to ski with [Triple Point Expeditions][tpx] (TPX) and [SEABA][seaba]. Here's a rough trip report composed of notes I jotted down each day and photos taken by me and others in my group.

### April 2

Big travel day today, starting with a trip to the San Diego airport at 4:30am. Flew through Seattle to Juneau, arriving around 3pm. From Juneau I decided to take a 30 minute [Wings of Alaska][wings] flight to Haines instead of the 3-4 hour ferry. The ferry trip is supposed to have great views and seems like a right-of-passage for skiers here, so maybe I'll try that out next time.

Did a quick safety overview and gear check with Tucker after landing in Haines. I'm good to go, and it looks like the weather might allow us to get on the snow tomorrow which would be great!

### April 3

Spent most of the morning on standby in my room at the [Captain's Choice Motel][ccm] as the weather did its thing. When the clear pockets move through there are great views of mountains to the southeast across the water.

Got called to the airport after lunch and put our boots on but didn't end up flying in the end. Met [John][jms] and Dan who will both be in my heli group and they were nice enough to take me up to a nearby mountain/zone called Old Faithful for some sled-accessed terrain. We had a hell of a time riding doubled up on their sleds (I have zero sled skills) but John and I ended up with one nice run. Can't believe how nice the snow was for the turns at the top. Very tired now but tomorrow's weather looks promising.

### April 4

First day skiing! Weather was great and snow stability was decent. It became very clear to me on the first few runs that skiing here requires many skills I do not yet have; [sluff management][sluff], reading steep features from above, and choosing safe lines based on stability and glacial features. I'm the least experienced in our group on this sort of terrain but we kept up a good pace all day and ended up with 12 runs (way above average). We saw one very large and humbling avalanche take place, but thankfully nobody was in it.

### April 5

Wow - another bluebird day. We were all pretty tired from yesterday so didn't push it quite as hard. Celebratory drinks and bell-ringing last night didn't help either. (The bars here all have a bell hanging in the corner which you can ring in order to buy a round of drinks for everyone there. Seems like there's always one person who just loves to hear that bell ring.)

On our last run I ended up taking the biggest crash of my life after choosing to make a turn on a small and unstable slab of snow which slid and took me out. No injuries, but looking forward to a rest day or two.

### April 6

Super tired and sore today after two days of hard skiing (and crashing). Luckily the weather forced us to lay low and rest. In the evening Tucker decided to bust out a snow kite and surfboard and take a shot at surfing the Chilkat River (photos below). Weather looks like it's going to keep us down for a few days but can change quickly so I'm learning not to worry about it too much.

### April 7

The rain continues. Went for a [3mi run](https://app.strava.com/activities/280979223) this morning and saw a bunch of bald eagles. 

### April 8

Another [rainy run](https://app.strava.com/activities/281525584) in the morning. 

### April 9

Hiked out to [Battery Point](https://app.strava.com/activities/282359499) with John and hit up the [Port Chilkoot Distillery](http://www.portchilkootdistillery.com) with John after. I have a feeling we'll be going back!

### April 10

Pouring rain in the morning and quite a bit colder than it has been. Went for a [chilly run](https://app.strava.com/activities/282747526) over to Mud Bay. The storm keeps raging and has even brought some wet snowflakes down to us at sea level.

### April 11

Tried to kill some time by visiting the [Sheldon Museum](http://www.sheldonmuseum.org/) in the morning but it took all of 30 minutes to fully explore.

Clouds tried to let us out this afternoon so we ran to the airport and threw our gear on. Guide ship went out and came back reporting that the snow was incredibly unstable. Not too surprising given the amount that has fallen in recent days. We're getting restless but the weather is trending positive for the next few days.

I'm supposed to leave tomorrow but am 99% sure I'm going to extend the trip by a few days in hopes of getting on snow once more. Ending the trip with a full week of down days would be quite a bummer. Another day on snow would make it worth the wait.

### April 12

Was supposed to leave today. Took the sleds north with John to try to ride a simple fire road but all the snow had melted. On the way home we stopped at a sketchy roadside fireworks shack to buy some entertainment for tomorrow night. A few minutes down the road we saw a moose stomping around in some wet marshes. A very AK day in the end, though not what we're here for.

### April 13

Glad I stuck around.

### April 14

Traveling home.
